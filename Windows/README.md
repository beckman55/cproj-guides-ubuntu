# Windows Setup Options

This folder provides multiple ways to install and use the `cproj-guides-ubuntu` automation toolkit on Windows.

Choose the option that best matches your environment:

## 1. Git Bash (Most Compatible, Lowest Requirements)
- Works on any Windows installation
- Only requires Git for Windows
- Recommended for most users

See: `git-bash/bootstrap-gitbash.md`

## 2. PowerShell (Native Windows)
- Uses PowerShell + GitHub CLI
- Runs Bash scripts through Git Bash
- Good for users who prefer Windows-native tooling

See: `powershell/bootstrap-powershell.md`

## 3. WSL (Best Linux Parity)
- Full Ubuntu environment inside Windows
- Identical behavior to a native Linux machine
- Recommended for developers who want full parity

See: `wsl/bootstrap-wsl.md`
